Description
-----------

This is my caual attempt at a Sudoku solver written in perl. 

I began it in 2008 and haven't done any work on it since. I thought it worked pretty well but when using it to test Amazon EC2 servers, I realized it's not a complete solution and gets stuck on some puzzles.

Going to fix it soon as time allows.

Even when I fix it, it's likely to remain a fairly naive solution and not at all efficient.

To Do
-----

* Cleanup Code (learned a lot in the last 5 years, can probably fix things)
* Fix to solve all puzzles
